            Epsilon Indi is an orange dwarf star located approximately 11.8 light-years away in the southern constellation Indus. This star is smaller and cooler than the Sun, classified as a K-type main-sequence star. Epsilon Indi is accompanied by a planetary system, including a gas giant, and it has two brown dwarf companions, Epsilon Indi Ba and Bb. These brown dwarfs are substellar objects, larger than planets but not massive enough to sustain hydrogen fusion like stars. Epsilon Indi's proximity and planetary system make it an intriguing candidate for future exoplanet exploration and study.
