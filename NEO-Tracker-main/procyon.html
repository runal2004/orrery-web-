          <p>
            Procyon, the brightest star in the constellation Canis Minor, is located 11.5 light-years from Earth. It is a binary system composed of Procyon A, a white-yellow main-sequence star, and Procyon B, a faint white dwarf. Procyon A is slightly larger and more massive than the Sun, while Procyon B, its companion, is a stellar remnant that has collapsed into a dense, dim star. The two stars orbit each other with a period of around 40 years. Procyon is one of the closest bright stars to Earth, and it plays a prominent role in both modern astronomy and ancient mythologies.
