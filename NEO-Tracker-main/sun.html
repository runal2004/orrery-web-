          <p>
            The Sun is the center of our solar system and a massive ball of hot, glowing gases primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. It generates energy through nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium, which releases immense heat and light. This energy is essential for life on Earth, driving weather, climate, and photosynthesis. The Sun's surface temperature is around 5,500°C (9,932°F), while its core reaches about 15 million°C. It's a G-type main-sequence star, often called a yellow dwarf, and is approximately 4.6 billion years old, with enough fuel to last another 5 billion years.
