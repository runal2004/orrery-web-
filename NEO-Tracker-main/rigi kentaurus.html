          <h2>RIGI KENTAURUS</h2>
          <p>
            Rigil Kentaurus (Alpha Centauri) is the closest star system to our solar system, situated about 4.37 light-years away. It consists of three stars: Alpha Centauri A, a Sun-like star; Alpha Centauri B, a slightly smaller star; and Proxima Centauri, a red dwarf that is the nearest of the three to Earth. Proxima Centauri is particularly notable for hosting Proxima b, an Earth-sized exoplanet located in its habitable zone. Alpha Centauri A and B form a binary system, while Proxima orbits at a much greater distance. This system is a primary focus in the search for extraterrestrial life and habitable planets.
