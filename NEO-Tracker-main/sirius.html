          <h2>SIRIUS</h2>
          <p>
            Sirius, also known as the Dog Star, is the brightest star visible from Earth, located 8.6 light-years away in the constellation Canis Major. It is a binary star system consisting of Sirius A, a white main-sequence star, and Sirius B, a faint white dwarf. Sirius A is about twice as massive as the Sun and much more luminous, while Sirius B is the remnant of a star that has exhausted its nuclear fuel. The pair orbits each other with a period of about 50 years. Due to its brightness and historical significance, Sirius has been an important star in various cultures.
