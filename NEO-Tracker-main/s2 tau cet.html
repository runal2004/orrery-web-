          <p>
            S2 Tau Ceti is a star located in the constellation Cetus, approximately 11.9 light-years from Earth. It's a G-type main-sequence star, similar to our Sun but slightly smaller and less luminous. With an apparent magnitude of 3.5, Tau Ceti is visible to the naked eye. The star is known for its stability and minimal stellar activity, making it an interesting target for the search for habitable exoplanets. Tau Ceti is surrounded by a debris disk, which suggests the presence of planetesimals. Multiple exoplanets have been detected in its orbit, some potentially located in the habitable zone.
